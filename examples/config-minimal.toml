# Minimal Sockrats Configuration
#
# This is the minimal configuration required to run Sockrats.
# Uses plain TCP transport (no encryption). For encrypted transport,
# configure the noise section (see config.toml for full example).

# Uncomment to use Noise protocol encryption:
# [client.transport]
# type = "noise"
#
# [client.transport.noise]
# remote_public_key = "base64-encoded-server-public-key"
